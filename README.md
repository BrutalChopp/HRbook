# QR Library Telegram Bot

A simple Telegram bot to manage a paper book library using QR codes. Built with `python-telegram-bot` 20+.

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` (this includes Pillow):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your bot token and administrator Telegram IDs.

## Network Access

This bot requires outgoing HTTPS access to `api.telegram.org`. If the domain is blocked you will see `NetworkError: httpx.ProxyError`.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure the host or container has internet access.
- Check that you can reach `https://api.telegram.org` using `curl` or similar.
- Configure your proxy or firewall to allow outbound requests to this domain.

## Usage

Run the bot with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Users register via `/start` and can take or return books using the menu buttons.
When starting the bot you will see a short welcome message describing its purpose.
During any step you can press the "‚Ü©Ô∏è –ù–∞–∑–∞–¥" button to cancel the current action
and return to the main menu. Use the `/menu` command at any time to show the main keyboard again.
Use the "üìñ –í—Å–µ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏" button to see a list of all books with their current status.
Administrators receive additional menu options for managing the library: adding books, generating reports, resetting book status and viewing the list of users.
All data is stored in `data/users.json` and `data/books.json`.
